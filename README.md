# Testing Task
#The main idea of solving the problem is that all axes of symmetry can be either on the bisectors of the corners of the polygon, or on the midpoints of the edges, and the axes formed by these points must pass through the center of the polygon.
The second idea is that if rotate all points around axes of symmetry, the appearance of the polygon will not change.
